# Logical's Perk Pack & Madgaz's PerkStandaloneV1_3 Pack bug


---
<strong>THAN0S</strong>:

When both Madgaz and Logical&#39;s perk packs are combined on a map the Banana Colada perk overlaps the ICU perk from Logical&#39;s pack. I&#39;ve seen both perk packs combined on the &quot;Town of the Tormented&quot; custom map so what&#39;s the secret to fixing this? It&#39;d be helpful for the people looking to combine both packs in their map in the future

the problem is 
they both use the same specialty names 

&quot;from banana colada GSH file&quot; 
#define PERK_BANANA_COLADA         &quot;specialty_immunecounteruav&quot;

&quot;From icu gsh&quot;

#define LOGICAL_PERK_ICU                  &quot;specialty_immunecounteruav&quot;
