# Logical's Cold War Weapons Pack (No Sounds)


---
<strong>Markus Darius</strong>:

So, I downloaded Logical&#39;s Cold War Weapon Pack from devraw site, I think I did everything right when installing it but in game the weapons makes no sounds.

I put the script inside my map szc file, the same that I put all the other sounds scripts:

the file seems to be in the right folder, but I don&#39;t think the file path is the problem, cuz I put everything in &quot;t9_weapons&quot; inside &quot;user_aliases&quot; but it didn&#39;t work either.

this is what the file looks like:

and that is the folder where all sounds are located:

<img src="1266">

also, all the audios in 48000hz:

It doesn&#39;t seems to be nothing wrong with the files, or maybe im too dumb to see whats wrong lmao, but 
I appreciate any help with this, thanks!!!
