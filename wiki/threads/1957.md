<p>Thread By: ZombieKid164<br />Okay, this might seem like a stupid question, but can I delete all the dump files in my root directory? I legitimately don&#39;t know but they take up a lot of space in there. (The ones with names like this: BlackOps3.exe.CODBUILD15-764.CL#2668796.1499988401) Also, what is the use for them?</p>

<p>Reply By: Scobalula<br />I delete them with no issues, they are just mini memory dumps that can be read for debug purposes (i.e. program crashes, check the memory dump to see what went wrong). Not sure how big they get for you but for me they are only a few hundred kb.</p>

Thanks!</p>
