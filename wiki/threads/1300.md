<p>Thread By: MyNameIsNobody<br />Is there a way to make it like on Der Riese where Dogs start spawning with zombies at the high rounds? I wanted to add dogs starting around level 30, but can&#39;t find anywhere anyone has discussed this. TIA!</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />lol whys everyone suddenly want this<br /> <br />anyway i cleaned up that code a bit ( Devnotes at the bottom ), i don&#39;t see any reason it should cause a crash, unless maybe you haven&#39;t placed dog spawners / spawn points in the map<br /> <br />[CODE=php]// Add to top of the script<br /><br />#using scripts\zm\_zm_ai_dogs;<br /><br />// Add directly after zm_usermap::main();:<br /><br />level thread dog_non_stop();<br /><br />// Paste function way down the bottom, not inside any other functions :<br /><br />function dog_non_stop()<br />{<br />	level endon( &quot;intermission&quot; );<br />	<br />	n_start_spawning_from_round 			= 30; 		// Round number<br />	n_minimum_zombie_total_for_spawn 		= 3;		// Minimum zombies remaining either &quot;now&quot; or &quot;left to spawn&quot; - if less the do spawning will pause till the next round<br />	n_minimum_delay_between_spawns 			= 2;		// Minimum wait in seconds between spawning dogs<br />	n_maximum_delay_between_spawns 			= 3;		// Maximum wait in seconds between spawning dogs<br />	<br />	while ( 1 )<br />	{<br />		level waittill( &quot;between_round_over&quot; ); // Wait till the end of a round<br />		<br />		if ( !isDefined( level.round_number ) || level.round_number &lt; n_start_spawning_from_round ) // If round number is less that decided above, loop back to start<br />			continue;<br />		<br />		while ( isDefined( level.zombie_total ) &amp;&amp; level.zombie_total &gt;= n_minimum_zombie_total_for_spawn ) // Loop this block of code &quot;only&quot; while there is a high enough zombie total either spawned or spawning<br />		{<br />			wait randomIntRange( n_minimum_delay_between_spawns, n_maximum_delay_between_spawns ); // Use the random delay<br />			<br />			zm_ai_dogs::special_dog_spawn( 1 ); // Force spawn a dog           <br />		}<br />	}<br />}<br /><br />// DEV NOTES : <br /><br />// Changed values to be easily changed and understandable to nooblets, better if you ever need to debug anyway<br /><br />// Removed the level variable and the check, no need for it as this function doesn&#39;t support toggling the loop &quot;back off&quot; as you throw straight into a loop which never breaks. Also if your threading this function &quot;at all&quot; obviously they are not going to set the variable to false lol<br /><br />// Added some isDefined checks to some of the values being passed, odds are these should never really be undefined, but you never know, and these are things that may potentially only error in Developer mode - which may seem irrelevant, but means when you really &quot;do&quot; need Developer mode to track down a problem, this error will block it first<br /><br />// Advised to thread &quot;after&quot; zm_usermap::main(); - This is safer for things that rely on stock code / functions / variables as it is all set up inside that function<br /><br />// Added a check to the second conditional loop to break when zombie count falls below the minimum - this will cause the first loop to repeat, up to the waittill on round over before running the second loop again<br /><br />// HarryBo21[/CODE]<br /> <br />This is definitely not how this should be done, people are constantly asking for this lately however so I will take a look through the code and post a proper way in a while<br /><br />Ill post to the wiki probably<br /> <br />EDIT : Ill see what i can do about the power switch lag too, I had already started a while back for Stevie, wrote out code, then got called away by modders and completely forgot about the code I wrote as usual lol.</p>

<p>Reply By: Kabe<br />Thanks for optimizing the code ;)<br />I updated it a little.<br />Now start when the round starts.<br />Now can detect if it is round of dogs and back to start.<br />Added level.dognon_stop to start / stop the spawn of dogs, if we are going to create some EE that requires it or simply use a cinematic while it is being played, simply add &quot; level.dognon_stop = true &quot; or &quot; level.dognon_stop = false &quot; of your code.<br />Now the zombie counter still has also the zombies that are alive and in turn can wake up zombie_ai_limit preventing the spawn of dogs.<br /><br />
[CODE=php]// Add to top of the script<br /><br />#using scripts\shared\flag_shared; //add this if it is not already<br />#using scripts\shared\ai\zombie_utility; //add this if it is not already<br />#using scripts\zm\_zm_ai_dogs;<br /><br />// Add directly after zm_usermap::main();<br /><br />level.dognon_stop = true;<br />level thread dog_non_stop();<br /><br />// Paste function way down the bottom, not inside any other functions :<br /><br />function dog_non_stop()<br />{<br />	level endon( &quot;intermission&quot; );<br />	<br />	n_start_spawning_from_round 			= 30; 		// Round number<br />	n_minimum_zombie_total_for_spawn 		= 3;		// Minimum zombies remaining either &quot;now&quot; or &quot;left to spawn&quot; - if less the do spawning will pause till the next round<br />	n_minimum_delay_between_spawns 			= 2;		// Minimum wait in seconds between spawning dogs<br />	n_maximum_delay_between_spawns 			= 3;		// Maximum wait in seconds between spawning dogs<br />	<br />	while ( 1 )<br />	{<br />		level waittill( &quot;start_of_round&quot; ); // Wait till the start round<br />		<br />		if ( !isDefined( level.round_number ) || level.round_number &lt; n_start_spawning_from_round || level flag::exists( &quot;dog_round&quot; ) &amp;&amp; level flag::get(&quot;dog_round&quot; ) || !isDefined( level.zombie_total )) // If round number is less that decided above, loop back to start<br />			continue;<br />		<br />		n_count_total_zombie = level.zombie_total;<br />		while ( n_count_total_zombie &gt;= n_minimum_zombie_total_for_spawn ) // Loop this block of code &quot;only&quot; while there is a high enough zombie total either spawned or spawning and level.dognon_stop = true<br />		{<br />			wait randomIntRange( n_minimum_delay_between_spawns, n_maximum_delay_between_spawns ); // Use the random delay<br />			n_count_zombies_spawn = zombie_utility::get_current_zombie_count(); //Count zombies spawned<br />			n_count_total_zombie = n_count_zombies_spawn + level.zombie_total; //Count zombies spawned + zombies spawning<br />			<br />			if( n_count_zombies_spawn &lt; level.zombie_ai_limit &amp;&amp; isDefined( level.dognon_stop ) &amp;&amp; level.dognon_stop ){ zm_ai_dogs::special_dog_spawn(1); }	 // Force spawn a dog if it does not reach the zombie_ai_limit<br />		}<br />	}<br />}<br /><br />// DEV NOTES : <br /><br />// Changed values to be easily changed and understandable to nooblets, better if you ever need to debug anyway<br /><br />// Removed the level variable and the check, no need for it as this function doesn&#39;t support toggling the loop &quot;back off&quot; as you throw straight into a loop which never breaks.

<p>Reply By: MyNameIsNobody<br />Thanks Kabe &amp; Harry both. I have been extremely ill and unable to test this until now. Thanks! P.s. the issue I had with the game crashing was unrelated and I fixed it.</p>
