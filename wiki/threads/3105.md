<p>Hi, I didn&#39;t test yet but here a quick question<br />I&#39;m trying to rotate a Windmill, which one should I use?</p>

<p>Depending on the direction try pitch first if it&#39;s not right try roll</p>

Mine is custimizable you can have some wait for power, play sounds, rotate any direction and so on. No disrespect to Wakka I just wanted something that anyone could use and would do everything they would want.</p>

<p>do i have to change the name of the target? like errm....   <br /><br />e_models = GetEntArray(&quot;rotate_ent&quot;, &quot;targetname&quot;);<br /><br />so like if i want it specific.  change &quot;rotate_ent&quot; to a different name. like<br /><br />e_models = GetEntArray(&quot;wheel&quot;, &quot;targetname&quot;);<br /><br />or whatever else i call the script model. ive done everything and its not working in game.<br /><br /> <br />function get_rotate_ents() {<br /><br />    e_models = GetEntArray(&quot;wagon_wheel&quot;, &quot;targetname&quot;);<br /><br />    for(i = 0; i &lt; e_models.size; i++) {<br />        e_models<em>thread rotate_ents();<br />    }<br />}<br />function rotate_ents() {<br /><br />    if(!isdefined(self.script_noteworthy)) {<br />        return;<br />    }<br />    if(isdefined(self.script_transition_time)) {<br />        time = self.script_transition_time;<br />    } else {<br />        time = 1;<br />    }<br />    if(isdefined(self.script_string) &amp;&amp; self.script_string == &quot;needs_power&quot;) {<br />        level waittill(&quot;power_on&quot;);<br />    }<br />    if(isdefined(self.script_sound)) {<br />        self PlayLoopSound(self.script_sound);<br />    }<br />  <br />    while(true) {<br /><br />        switch(self.script_noteworthy) {<br /> case &quot;pitch&quot;:<br />                self RotatePitch(0, 0);<br />                break;<br />            case &quot;yaw&quot;:<br />                self RotateYaw(0, 0);<br />                break;<br />            case &quot;roll&quot;:<br />                self RotateRoll(360, 15);<br />                break;<br />        }<br />        wait(time - .1);<br />    }<br />}<br /> im gonna assume thats how the rotates work right? and yes the other part is in the main() part.  i got no errors. its just not rotating. thanks</em></p>

<p>Make sure you read the script doc it tells you how to set it up. Just make sure you read it carefully</p>

<p>Just a suggestion. Maybe post a sample test map with all required files so whoever uses it can download and compare. (That&#39;s what Wakka and I did with that other rotating one)</p>

<p>Hey thanks for the suggestion, I just really don&#39;t see the point in making a test map for this. It&#39;s really simple to follow the instruction. Maybe adding a prefab of a script_model setup with kvps would be doable, but even with that there are many options I wouldn&#39;t post every possibility.</p>

<p>dude, i got the script working like a charm. thank you so much for it. your a legend. it was just me being a bit of an idiot, sorry for the trouble.<br /><br />and the answer is yes.  just change the  (&quot;rotate_ent&quot;, &quot;targetname&quot;) to whatever it is like (&quot;rotate_clock&quot;,&quot;targetname).</p>

<p>Just a tip guys, if you&#39;re using this for larger scale things and /or need more configuration you should bake this into a &#39;siege animation&#39;. You can set them in radiant w/o any scripting. They also support loading in/out when you are away from them, etc. Just optimization stuff.</p>

You should give the script_model/script_brushmodel the name of the kvp I have in script. It even says that.  all script_models/script_brushmodels should have the targetname rotate_ents in radiant</p>

Gave the script_brushmodel the targetname of &quot;wheel&quot; and kvp script_noteworthy &quot;roll&quot; then went in to the script and changed that portion to (&quot;wheel&quot;,&quot;targetname&quot;)  but yeah I get it now. The way you did it is so anything in the map that you want rotating in the map uses the same string. But wouldn&#39;t that effect other object you want moving at different speeds? If I have &quot;roll&quot; on one with (360, 15). Everything with &quot;roll&quot; kvp will move at the same speed right?  So all I did was separate it as its own entity is all. It works perfect.</p>

Don&#39;t change the script just follow the instructions. If you have to change it, but everyone else including me never have to. Then you are doing something really wrong.</p>
