<p>Thread By: OrderAndDEATH<br />I want to change the window repair so it will give you more then just 10 points when you repair them. Is it possible?</p>

Is it possible?</blockquote><br /> Maybe. You need to copy the the _zm_blockers.gsc in your mapname/script/zm folder, add it to your zone and usings. then find this function where you probably can change the cost:<br /> <br />[CODE=php]function handle_post_board_repair_rewards( cost, zbarrier )<br />{<br />	self zm_stats::increment_client_stat( &quot;boards&quot; );<br />	self zm_stats::increment_player_stat( &quot;boards&quot; );		<br />	<br />	// 5% chance every 5 boards, with a 60 sec minimum time between repeats<br />	if( isDefined(self.pers[&quot;boards&quot;] ) &amp;&amp; self.pers[&quot;boards&quot;] %10 == 0 )<br />	{<br />		self zm_audio::create_and_play_dialog( &quot;general&quot;, &quot;rebuild_boards&quot; );<br />	}<br /><br />	// set the score<br />	self.rebuild_barrier_reward += cost;<br />	if( self.rebuild_barrier_reward &lt; level.zombie_vars[&quot;rebuild_barrier_cap_per_round&quot;] )<br />	{<br />		self zm_score::player_add_points( &quot;rebuild_board&quot;, cost );<br />		self zm_utility::play_sound_on_ent( &quot;purchase&quot; );<br />		<br />	}<br />	// general contractor achievement for dlc 2. keep track of how many board player repaired.<br />	if(isdefined(self.board_repair))<br />	{<br />		self.board_repair += 1;<br />	}<br />}[/CODE]</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />In the beginning of the function <span style="color:#ff0000;">blocker_trigger_think</span> the cost is defined and it seems you can define the cost as a kvp on the window prefab (or struct inside) like with doors.<br /> <br />so kvp = zombie_cost<br />value = 1000<br /> <br /> <br />[CODE=php]	cost = 10;<br />	if( isdefined( self.zombie_cost ) )<br />	{<br />		cost = self.zombie_cost; <br />	}[/CODE]<br /> <br /> <br />but I&#39;m not sure. Havn&#39;t tried it.</p>

This will cap the amount of points you can get per round.</p>
