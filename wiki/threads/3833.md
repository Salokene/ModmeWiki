Hello! i have a problem with the refleftion proble, the doors don&#39;t stop the light, there&#39;s a lot of light from the door, i tried a lot of things, changing textures, changing the door model, creating a new map, a lot of things, and nothing.
I attached a photo, to see how it is.
the walls are 16 thickness, i need help xd. Thank for all help!
pd: i can&#39;t attach photos i don&#39;t know why.

Would help if we could see the photo
If you can get it attached it might make it easier to help you out
