# "Frosty Extractor and other tool like" Are we able to extract and convert animations from BF stuff ?

Hi, there !

The question I&#39;m about to ask must have been thought for a long time by the more knowledgeable among you.
But I haven&#39;t really found an answer.

Is it possible to convert the original battlefield animations and rigs, to sea-file? Be it the weapons or the other.
So far I had to animate some models myself.

But is there a possible solution ? Whether it&#39;s through a custom scriped tool or something like this ?

Or is the process too long and difficult to be feasible?

I understand that the only one who wanted them, Ege115, had to rig and animate them himself

Hoping that you could enlighten me
