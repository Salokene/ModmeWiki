<p>I made a teleporter to an area of the map that is not connected to the original, but there is no NavMesh so the Zombies just stand still when they spawn in. Is there a fix for this?</p>

<p>Put down a [ICODE]node_pathnode[/ICODE] to tell the game the area should have a nav mesh (the nav mesh basically flood fills from them and [ICODE]info_player_start[/ICODE]).</p>
