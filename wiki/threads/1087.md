<p>Thread By: Symbo<br />Hello,<br /> <br />I try to modify the script to do some other things than what is pre-offer once the soul chest is complete but, after hours, I am going nowhere.<br /> <br />Is there a way to simply create a function, waittill the soul chest is done, then do stuff? I found this: if(level.grow_souls[system]&lt;=0) but it&#39;s not helping.<br /> <br />Thanks</p>

Thanks</blockquote><br /> Hello! First of all, not sure if the &quot;NSZ&quot; is referring to asking NateSmithZombies this question, but he did not create this script, and I highly recommend that you ask the creator of the script how to do what you are trying to accomplish in the future if that is the case. Anyways, I have found a way to modify it so you can make it do stuff (like activating a flag, or maybe running a script) other than giving the default rewards. <br /> <br />Here&#39;s a basic rundown of what I did:<br /> <br />First, I deleted everything<strong>inside</strong> of the SetUpReward Function and added these lines in it instead:<br />[CODE=php]function SetUpReward()<br />{<br />	level waittill(&quot;allgrowsouls&quot;);<br />	level flag::set(&quot;soul_boxes_done&quot;);<br />}[/CODE]<br />then, I deleted everything <strong>inside</strong> the GrowSoulEnding function (Make sure to keep it).<br />[CODE=php]function GrowSoulEnding()<br />{<br /><br />}[/CODE]<br />That&#39;s all I did I believe. Take note that this activates a flag, so what I did was add this flag in a waittill in the script I was using this for, like so:<br />[CODE=php]level flag::wait_till( &quot;soul_boxes_done&quot; );<br /><br />//Note: you will need to add &quot;#using scripts\shared\flag_shared;&quot; at the top of your script[/CODE]<br />Alternatively, you could activate a function of a script by adding a #using with your script at the top of the grow_souls script and then replace my &quot;level flag::set(&quot;soul_boxes_done&quot;);&quot; with &quot;level thread your_script_name::init();&quot; or something like that. Hopefully you find this useful!</p>
