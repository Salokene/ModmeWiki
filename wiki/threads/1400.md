<p>Thread By: ltschase<br />I would like to know how to start and stop an &quot;ambient&quot; sound. I was hoping that by using Nate Smith&#39;s ambient sounds method with the structs, that I could simply stop and start the sound by hiding and showing the structs, but that didn&#39;t work, so I am not sure how to do it. If you don&#39;t understand what am I wanting to do exactly, for example, I want to have the sound of a generator running, but the generator isn&#39;t always running, so the sound needs to turn on and off.</p>

<p>Reply By: ihmiskeho<br />I don&#39;t know how Nate&#39;s script works, but you could use PlayLoopSound(&lt;sound&gt;, fadetime) to start the sound and StopLoopSound(fadetime) to stop it.&lt;/sound&gt;<br /> <br />There is info about these function (and basically about all BO3 functions) in the scriptapifunctions. That can be found in Black ops 3 root/deffiles/docs_modtools.<br />&lt;h1&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;</p>

Instead what I would recommend is spawning in an invisible entity, playing a loop sound on that entity, and deleting that entity when you want to stop the sound.<br /> <br />[CODE=php]SoundOrg = util::spawn_model( &quot;tag_origin&quot;, &lt;location&gt; );<br />SoundOrg PlayLoopSound(&quot;alias_name&quot;);<br />SoundOrg Delete();&lt;/location&gt;[/CODE]<br /> <br /> <br />You will need this #using in order to use the spawn_model function however:<br />[CODE=php]#using scripts\shared\util_shared;[/CODE]</p>

<p>Reply By: Symbo<br />Abnormal you got me curious. StopLoopSound always worked for me. I just found this function in sound_shared.gsc that suggest you can specify the alias you want to stop instead of the fadetime. <br /> <br />[CODE=php]function loop_on_tag( alias, tag, bStopSoundOnDeath )<br />{<br />	org = Spawn( &quot;script_origin&quot;, ( 0, 0, 0 ) );<br />	org endon( &quot;death&quot; );<br />	if ( !isdefined( bStopSoundOnDeath ) )<br />	{<br />		bStopSoundOnDeath = true;<br />	}<br />	if ( bStopSoundOnDeath )<br />	{<br />		thread util::delete_on_death( org );<br />	}<br />	if( isdefined( tag ) )<br />	{<br />		org LinkTo( self, tag, ( 0, 0, 0 ), ( 0, 0, 0 ) );<br />	}<br />	else<br />	{<br />		org.origin = self.origin;<br />		org.angles = self.angles;<br />		org LinkTo( self );<br />	}<br />	//	org endon( &quot;death&quot; );<br />	org PlayLoopSound( alias );<br />	//	println( &quot;playing loop sound &quot;, alias, &quot; on entity at origin &quot;, self.origin, &quot; at ORIGIN &quot;, org.origin );<br />	self waittill( &quot;stop sound&quot; + alias );<br />	org StopLoopSound( alias );<br />	org Delete();<br />}[/CODE]<br />So if anyone wanna use it, you need this using: <br />[CODE=php]#using scripts\shared\sound_shared;[/CODE]<br />and you can call it just with the alias or also specify a tag if you want to: <br />[CODE=php]entity thread sound::loop_on_tag( &quot;alias_name&quot;);[/CODE]<br />and apparently stop the sound like this: <br />[CODE=php]entity notify( &quot;stop sound&quot; + &quot;alias_name&quot; );[/CODE]</p>
