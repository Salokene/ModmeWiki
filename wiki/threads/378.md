<p>Reply By: soul-toktzt<br />Do you have the back-up? or do you mean the autobackup?<br /> <br />Autobackup: BO3 root folder --&gt; Radiant --&gt; autosave_backup<br /> <br />You got the .map file, copy it, go to BO3 root folder --&gt; map source --&gt; zm and paste it there.<br /> <br />Well i think this is how you do it, if not... i&#39;m doing it the wrong way the whole time.</p>
