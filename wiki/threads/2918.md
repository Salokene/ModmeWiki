<p>I thought I&#39;d make this thread to try and find anyone willing to help me with this project, give tips or just get motivation to keep me away from a creative block lol. This map takes place in a kind of nightmare realm where you have to teleport to different sections of the map and complete certain objectives. There will be a main area that works as the spawn room, with 4 SoE style portals that lead into its corresponding section. The first four sections will each have 3 artifacts scattered somewhere and upon finding all 12, a secret room will be opened within those sections that lead to the next 4 locations. In these areas, rituals will have to be completed (collecting zombie souls). One of these sections will also house the power switch. Upon completing all 4 rituals, a portal will spawn in the main room leading to the Pack-A-Punch/Boss Fight Arena. I&#39;ll try to update this thread regularly to keep anyone interested in helping - or just interested in my idea - updated on what&#39;s going on.  :)</p>

<p>[COLOR=rgb(44, 130, 201)]<strong>Update 12/7/19 - </strong>[/COLOR][COLOR=rgb(255, 255, 255)]Layout of spawn room and south portal room done + some xmodels have been put in and have their clips. Tomorrow I&#39;ll have to troubleshoot Radiant not running any of my custom maps (closes BO3 without giving an error message after compiling), then I&#39;ll begin working on the north portal room.[/COLOR]</p>

<p><blockquote>sick also try put some rubble and rock models on the floor to get the vibe i think you want to accomplish it will also add some detail<br /></blockquote><br />I tend to hold off on the smaller xmodels until I feel like I have enough of the larger ones, but the south room is pretty much done so I&#39;ll start there and see how it turns out.</p>
