The ones with the label &quot;ADS&quot; will select ADS joints.<br /><br /><br /><br />The one labeled &quot;JOINT&quot; will delete unnecessary tags in IW Worldmodels for red dot, etc.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Why not just select/delete them myself?</span></strong><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />When doing a batch of anims/models you really just want to get it done nice and fast. This saves me time when I got export each anim all I need to do is press a button instead of selecting joints, then Select Hierarchy, etc.<br /><br /><br /><br />For the worldmodel deleter it&#39;s equally as tiresome when doing multiple LODs to delete each tag except tag_weapon, brass, and flash, this does it at the click of a button.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">What&#39;s the point if I can just get Lemon 1.42 and get xanims?</span></strong><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />1.423 is the only version that will work with Ghosts and thus you still need to convert tanims for it. The 3arc side of the script was only added for convenience and in case some people want to export a batch of modified anims.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Installing</span></strong><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />All you need to do is navigate to Documents\Maya\*Your Maya Ver&quot;, open the archive in the download and copy the prefs folder inside the &quot;Your Maya Ver&quot; folder to yours.<br /><br /><br /><br />Then, open the file in the prefs/shelves&#39;s folder called &quot;shelf_Scoba&quot; with a program that has a &quot;Find/Replace&quot; features, and replace:<br /><br /><br /><br />[CODE=php]YOUR_MUMS_USERNAME[/CODE]<br /><br /><br /><br />With your username, which is probably indeed your mum&#39;s since you&#39;re using her laptop of course!</p>

<p>Reply By: Scobalula<br />Updated to support Lil&#39;s so it will select the joints with the namespace &quot;bo2&quot;, you can click the button whether you have his scene loaded or normal, it just checks for that namespace.</p>
