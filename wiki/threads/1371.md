<p>Thread By: Abnormal202<br />&lt;h2&gt;<span style="color:#00ffff;">ABNORMAL202 AMBIENT MUSIC SYSTEM</span>&lt;/h2&gt;<br /> <br /> <br />&lt;h3&gt;<span style="color:#00ffff;">DESCRIPTION</span>&lt;/h3&gt;<br /> <br />So I was looking through the files of my new map, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1212683762&searchtext=afterbirth">Afterbirth</a>, to see what I could release to the public and I found my ambient music system. I beefed it up and added more options for the public, and so now I&#39;m releasing it.<br /> <br />This system essentially creates a shuffled order of songs (2D sound aliases) and plays them for all players to hear. it comes with triggers that when pressed will stop/start the ambient music so players can turn it on/off at will. It also has the option to print the song&#39;s name in the top-left corner when it starts playing.<br /> <br />Note if you are looking to play non-2D aliases for things such as sound effects, you may want to try <a href="http://aviacreations.com/modme/index.php?view=topic&tid=309">NSZ&#39;s Ambient Sounds Tutorial</a>.<br /> <br />Personally I think adding the right music to a map can make a huge difference in the atmosphere and mood of the map, and help players really <strong>feel</strong> something when playing.<br /> <br />&lt;h3&gt;<span style="color:#00ffff;">HOW TO INSTALL</span>&lt;/h3&gt;<br /> <br /> <br />Instructions are included in the download but here they are here as well:<br /> <br />[CODE=php]ABNORMAL202 AMBIENT MUSIC SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS<br /><br />1.
