<p>Thread By: dimakristally<br />I have a trigger in my map with a custom KVP called &#39;teleport_cost&#39;.  How can I get the value of this KVP via GSC?  I have tried the following and it has not worked, I was specifically told that the cost was undefined. <br />[CODE=php]trigger = GetEnt(&quot;teleport_trigger&quot;, &quot;targetname&quot;);<br />teleport_cost = trigger.teleport_cost;<br /><br />while (1 &lt; 2)<br />{<br />    trigger waittill(&quot;trigger&quot;, player);<br />    player zm_score::minus_to_player_score(teleport_cost);<br />    // Do teleport stuff...<br />}[/CODE]<br />Please lend me your knowledge on how I can access this KVP via GSC.  (Please do not suggest workarounds, I would like to use the KVP.)<br /> <br />Thanks!<br /> <br />Edit: fixed minus_to_player_score call, wrote it incorrectly from memory.</p>

I typed this from another computer, it minuses the teleport cost in the actual script, I just wasn&#39;t thinking when I typed this out.  Good catch ;)</p>

You&#39;ll need to put a cost in manually or define it in the beginning of the script.</blockquote><br /> No, that&#39;s definitely possible. I think the script should work, but just to be sure, can you send us a picture of your KVPs in radiant?</p>

Everything is fine on the radiant side.</p>
