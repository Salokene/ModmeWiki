<strong><span style="color:#34a7f9;">VividNo</span>:</strong>

So my cold war 1911&#39;s sound is working perfectly fine
But every weapon ive added after that has had no sound example: (ANY WWII GUNS), (ANY COLD WAR GUNS), (ANY BLACK OPS 1 GUNS)
Im sure ive done it all right i did the same thing as i did with the 1911 (which works)
Ive added the line of text to user_aliases, zm_levelcommon_weapons (in my zm_&quot;mapname&quot;) and my zone folder


Any help would be appreciated :)

check if the sound file is .wav and if the frequence is 48000Hz in audacity like that for each sound <img src="1259">
