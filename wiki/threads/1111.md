<p>Thread By: Sylvacre<br />I had trouble deciding which starting pistol I wanted to use in my map, so I instead created a script to allow the player to decide for themselves!<br />This script currently only allows for 2 options. It gives the player 10 seconds, then takes away whichever gun they aren&#39;t holding.<br /> <br />Instructions:<br /> <br />Open your mapname.gsc located in (Call of Duty Black Ops III\usermaps\map_name\scripts\zm)<br /> <br />At the top, somewhere within main, add this line and replace the text in quotes with the name of the second weapon you want as an option:<br /> <br />[CODE=php]level thread choose_pistol(&quot;t7_pistol_m1911&quot;);[/CODE]<br /> <br />Then, at the bottom, add this function:<br /> <br />[CODE=php]function choose_pistol(secondWep)<br />{<br />	level flag::wait_till( &quot;initial_blackscreen_passed&quot; );<br />	players = GetPlayers();<br />	secondary = GetWeapon(secondWep);<br /><br />	foreach(player in players)<br />		player GiveWeapon(secondary);<br />		<br />	IPrintLnBold(&quot;Choose your starting pistol. The other will disappear in 10 seconds.&quot;);<br />	wait(7);<br />	for(i=3;i&gt;0;i--)<br />	{<br />		IPrintLnBold(i+&quot;&quot;);<br />		wait(1);<br />	}<br />	foreach(player in players)<br />	{<br />		choice = player GetCurrentWeapon();<br />		ammo_clip = player GetWeaponAmmoClip(choice);<br />		ammo_fuel = player GetWeaponAmmoFuel(choice);<br />		ammo_stock = player GetWeaponAmmoStock(choice);<br />		player TakeAllWeapons();<br />		player GiveWeapon(choice);<br />		player giveWeapon( level.weaponBaseMelee );<br />		player SetWeaponAmmoClip(choice,ammo_clip);<br />		player SetWeaponAmmoFuel(choice,ammo_fuel);<br />		player SetWeaponAmmoStock(choice,ammo_stock);<br />		level thread zm::award_grenades_for_survivors(); <br />	}<br />	IPrintLnBold(&quot;Starting pistol locked in.&quot;);<br />}[/CODE]<br /> <br /> <br />Done!<br />When you load into your map it will give you your &quot;second&quot; weapon alongside your normal starting pistol and after 10 seconds will take away the one you aren&#39;t holding.<br /> <br /> <br />Disclaimer: I am by no means an experienced scripter and it&#39;s very possible there&#39;s a better way to make this script so if anyone has suggestions for how it can be made better I&#39;m open to hearing them. I would think there&#39;s probably a better way to do the last part of the script in particular, but I tried many different things and wasn&#39;t able to figure out a &quot;better&quot; way.</p>
