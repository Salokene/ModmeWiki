<p>I&#39;ve always Imported sounds and they&#39;ve worked, but recently any sound I try and import it does not work for some reason<a href="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.852.PNG' | relative_url }}">Download "new1.PNG"</a><br />My Hz is set to 48000<br /><a href="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.853.PNG' | relative_url }}">Download "new2.PNG"</a><br />I save my files as this<br /><a href="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.854.PNG' | relative_url }}">Download "new3.PNG"</a><br />all of the sounds on the bottom work but begin_ritual does not <br /><a href="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.855.PNG' | relative_url }}">Download "new4.PNG"</a><br />and on line 1090 is where I am playing the sound<br /><br />I&#39;ve tried <strong>PlaySound(&quot;begin_ritual&quot;);</strong><br /><br />I&#39;ve also tried <strong>ritual_1 PlaySound(&quot;begin_ritual&quot;):</strong> and nothing seems to be working.<br /><a href="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.856.PNG' | relative_url }}">Download "new5.PNG"</a><br />I&#39;ve also used the same exact way to play sounds and they worked before. e.g line 959 965 and 971.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know what Im doing thats any different if anyone knows what im doing wrong please let me know.<br /><br />Thanks!</p>
