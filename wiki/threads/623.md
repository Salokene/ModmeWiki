<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br />This is completely untested so report back with a confirmation if it works or if it doesn&#39;t:<br /><br /><br /><br />Instructions: <br /><br />--------------<br /><br />1) Copy and paste the below code at the bottom of your mapname.gsc ( Example Location: C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops III\usermaps\zm_test\zone_source )<br /><br />[CODE=php]function shootable_trigs()<br />{<br />	level.shootable_door_count = 0; <br />	trigs = GetEntArray( &quot;shootable_door&quot;, &quot;targetname&quot; ); <br />	level.shootable_door_goal = trigs.size; <br />	foreach( trig in trigs )<br />		trig thread wait_for_shoot(); <br />}<br /><br />function wait_for_shoot()<br />{<br />	self waittill( &quot;trigger&quot;, player ); <br />	player PlayLocalSound( &quot;zmb_cha_ching&quot; ); 	// Change this to any sound alias you want<br />	level.shootable_door_count++; <br />	if( level.shootable_door_count == level.shootable_door_goal )<br />		self open_door(); <br />}<br /><br />function open_door()<br />{<br />	doors = GetEntArray( &quot;shootable_door_reward&quot;, &quot;targetname&quot; ); <br />	<br />	foreach( door in doors )<br />		door PlaySound( &quot;zmb_cha_ching&quot; ); <br />	wait(0.05); <br />	foreach( door in doors )<br />		door delete(); <br />	<br />	flag = doors[0].script_flag; <br />	level flag::set( flag ); <br />}[/CODE]<br /><br /><br /><br />2) At the top of your mapname.gsc add the following code:<br /><br />[CODE=php]level shootable_trigs(); [/CODE]<br /><br />Underneath: <br /><br />[CODE=php]function main()<br />{[/CODE]<br /><br /><br /><br />3) In &#39;Entity Browser&#39; place a trigger&gt;damage with the following KVP&#39;s ( Press N with the trigger selected to add KVPs )<br /><br />targetname - shootable_door<br /><br /><br /><br />Note: Place as many as you would like as long as they all have the same KVPs<br /><br /><br /><br />4) Place a script&gt;model or script&gt;brushmodel with the following KVPs: <br /><br />targetname - shootable_door_reward<br /><br />script_flag - flag_to_start_spawners_in_this_zone <br /><br /><br /><br />Note: Place as many doors as you would like just be sure they all have the same KVPs and that the script_flag is the name of the flag that you would normally put on the trigger of the door to initiate the spawners in that zone. The script_flag is intentionally on the door and not the trigger in this script DONT PUT THE SCRIPT_FLAG ON THE TRIGGERS<br /><br /><br /><br />Thats it. Like I said it is untested so let me know if it works. I am too occupied to test myself lol</p>

<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br /><blockquote><em>Pedrehitor74</em>I tried it and it does not work when I start the game the door is already open</blockquote><br /><br />Looks like I accidentally added an &#39;s&#39; to trig. I edited the original code and tested it myself. It does work now. Give it another try</p>

<p>Reply By: Pedrehitor74<br />I already tried it and now if that works perfect, it could be added instead of shooting a bear to shoot 3 bears and that there will be the door? Thanks</p>

<p>Reply By: Pedrehitor74<br />As would the script if instead of shooting a bear can shoot three bears and open the door</p>

If you want 3 bears to be shot just place 3 trigger&gt;damages with the KVPs I listed on top of a teddy bear</p>

<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br /><blockquote><em>hazzy155</em>does anybody have a list of sound aliases? or how to get them.</blockquote><br /><br />I have always found it easier to make my own than to dig for them. I remade alot of stock aliases such as meteor_loop, deny, cha_ching. The tools are just so incomplete due to licensing issues that they cant seem to even give us the sounds to listen to anyway</p>
