<p><blockquote>I need help for a map I am currently working on. I need to have someone who is experienced with scripting easter egg steps.<br /><br />If you are interested, please DM me and we will talk about EVERYTHING involving what I need done and all that, etc. When my map is released on the Steam Workshop, you will take FULL credit next to me in the creation of the map as the &quot;scripter&quot; part.<br /><br /><br />Please DM me if interested, even if others have already mentioned that they have messaged me down below.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Jeme07<br /></blockquote><br />You couldn&#39;t just type your own original post, huh? xD</p>
