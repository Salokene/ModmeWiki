<p>Hello, glad to see the FX pack updated &amp; bugs fixed with it compared to older version (i.e. explosion stuff). just wanted to report an issue I&#39;ve noted; the AR &amp; Sniper PaP muzzle FX don&#39;t seem to produce any gas flash, only smoke - any chance to get this fixed? Cheers<br /><br />Edit: took a look at fx_muz_md_gas_flash_1p_ug_zmb, it looks like it must&#39;ve had an error on first import and broke itself<br />edit 2: Can verify issue affects fx_muz_md_gas_flash_1p_ug_zmb &amp; fx_muz_xlg_gas_flash_1p_ug_zmb and their 3p variants, re-exporting and re-patching fixes</p>

<p>Amazing work Harry, glad you&#39;re back with quality releases. I only have one problem (most likely it might be with my side of mod tools). When linking the map, this warning appears:<br />{% highlight php %}
^3WARNING: &quot;explosion&quot; is not a valid shellshock

  shellshock:explosion
    csv:zone_source/zm_nova_test.zone{% endhighlight %}
<br />I can still open the map in-game with them spawning in, however once a Nova Crawler dies, the game instant closes (guess that might be due to the shellshock warning).</p>

<p>Not Having any issues with it at all  in a test map ie only nova scripts have fx shellshock and ver 2.01 installed they die without issues ie no crashing <br /><br />however i do get this <br /><br />1The model (c_zom_dlchd_kino_quad_behead) uses material (mtl_c_t7_zm_dlchd_gib_cloth_alpha) but there is no techset for surface 3 which im sure i  can rectify in ape</p>

<p>so i have it working i wanted to see if i could replicate the .csc  error that he&#39;s having 1st thing i tried was remover the actor spawner got the same error<br /><br />so it could be unrelated but just trying to help narrow it down for you<br /><br /><br />I have however found a possible bug they spawned during dog rounds which i thought was cool killed all the dogs got my max ammo killed the 2 quads round did not change ??</p>

<p>Before copying the scripts folder to your mapname , open the scripts folder first then you&#39;ll find 3 script files copy them to your mapname/scripts/zm if you dont do this you will get errors becsuse if you drag and drop the scripts folder from to download to your mapname folder it will place the scripts in the wrong folder.</p>
