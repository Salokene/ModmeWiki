Anyone know how I would go about adding a timer on\-screen that counts down?

I haven&#39;t tried making a count down timer, but I do intend on it because I want to make a &quot;chaos mode&quot; kind of like the one in extinction.
I just figured I&#39;d try to tell you where I was going to start on trying to figure out a timer that counts down, since it&#39;s better than nothing haha.

You can look at the ugx timed gameplay script for their timer that counts up and use it as a base for a timer to count down.
instead of using the function settimerup use settimer, which sets a timer to count down, alter the countdown time, etc.

edit. you can also look at the giants teleporter for how the timer is done as well.
