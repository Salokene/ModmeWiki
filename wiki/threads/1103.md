<p>Thread By: Dextro62<br />I have an area in my map that hurts the player if they enter it. I would like it to play a looping sound when the player enters the trigger_hurt that then stops when the player leaves the trigger hurt. I&#39;d also like to have it so that only the player in the trigger_hurt hears the sound.<br />I attempted to script this myself but the sound didn&#39;t loop and it only played the first time I touched the trigger.<br />Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />I haven&#39;t tested it, but see if you can get this to work:<br />[CODE=php]function hurt_trig_sound()<br />{<br />	trig = GetEnt(&quot;HURT TRIG TARGETNAME&quot;,&quot;targetname&quot;);<br />	players = GetPlayers();<br />	while(1)<br />	{<br />		foreach( player in players)<br />		{<br />			if( player IsTouching(trig))<br />			{<br />				player playloopsound (&quot;YOUR ALIAS NAME HERE&quot;);<br />				player.was_in_hurt_trig = true;<br />			}<br />			else if(player.was_in_hurt_trig == true)<br />			{<br />				player stoploopsound();<br />				player.was_in_hurt_trig = false;<br />			}<br />		}<br />		wait(0.05);<br />	}<br />}[/CODE]<br />I&#39;m not sure how the looping sound functions work, I haven&#39;t used them yet, but see if this works.</p>

<p>Reply By: Dextro62<br />I tried this but the sound didn&#39;t play. I added couple of lines of code to display text messages to see what lines of code was running.<br />It looked like this.<br />[CODE=php]function hurt_trig_sound()<br />{<br />	trig = GetEnt(&quot;hurt&quot;,&quot;targetname&quot;);<br />	players = GetPlayers();<br />	while(1)<br />	{<br />		foreach( player in players)<br />		IPrintLnBold (&quot;after foreach player&quot;);<br />		{<br />			if( player IsTouching(trig))<br />			{<br />				player playloopsound (&quot;d_switch_on2&quot;);<br />				player.was_in_hurt_trig = true;<br />				IPrintLnBold (&quot;after hurt trig is true&quot;);<br />			}<br />			else if(player.was_in_hurt_trig == true)<br />			{<br />				player stoploopsound();<br />				player.was_in_hurt_trig = false;<br />				IPrintLnBold (&quot;after hurt trig false&quot;);<br />			}<br />		}<br />		wait(0.05);<br />	}<br />}[/CODE]<br /> <br /> <br />As soon as the game started the text &quot;after trig hurt is true&quot; kept repeating and didn&#39;t stop.</p>
