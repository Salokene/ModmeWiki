<p>So I&#39;ve been trying to create a pistol defense map akin to the one from World at War and I&#39;ve added these guns:<br />- Skye&#39;s BO1 Minigun<br />- Skye&#39;s MW2 M93 Raffica<br />- Skye&#39;s MW3 FMG9<br />- Skye&#39;s BO4 Strife<br />- pmr360&#39;s BOCW Revolver<br /><br />Every one of these guns sounds just don&#39;t work. I even went and edited every single file name from the user_aliases.csv file to see if that would fix the issue and it still hasn&#39;t fixed the issue. I&#39;ve tried almost everything and I&#39;m not exactly sure what I should do next to fix this issue.<br /><br />There&#39;s also a side issue with pmr360&#39;s BOCW Revolver port where when I PAP it, it just doesn&#39;t come out of the PAP. The PAP just eats the revolver and doesn&#39;t give it back.</p>
