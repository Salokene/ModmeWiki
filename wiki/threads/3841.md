# Animation Not Fully Playing in Game, But works in APE


---
<strong>Fanatic</strong>:

Ported an animation of this doorway blowing up, and it looks like it&#39;s fully working in APE, but when I try it in game, it looks as if half of the wooden shards aren&#39;t animated and just appear instantly.

This is my first time working with animations, so apologies if it&#39;s an easy fix.

That&#39;s the vid I followed at first, and tried the tag_origin fix and didn&#39;t seem to work.

Although, if it fully plays in APE with no issues, would it be a problem with MAYA?
