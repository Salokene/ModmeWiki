   v1.1
          - Fixed the Ray Gun. It was missing the GDT for the effects and I didn&#39;t realise
   v1.0
          - Released the Improved BO3 Ray Gun

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Improved BO3 Ray Gun</span></strong> - <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">V1.1</span></strong> - <a href="https://mega.nz/file/3sVDAYiB#8VLmWqFkfoDObcKA2hb94kFr00GOEoOrjircf8XjaAQ"><strong>Download</strong></a>

    -Added Jump, Fall, Walk and Slide animations (Don&#39;t know why it doesn&#39;t have them already)
    -Changed the reticle back to red instead of the ugly white
    -Fixed the view model position, being so close to camera
    -Fixed the alignment of the aim down sights as Treyarch horribly misaligned it
    -Changed the effects back to how they were in preview COD&#39;s, using BO2 as the source as BO3&#39;s Ray Gun effects are awful
    -Doubled the damage to compensate for the balance change, with Double Tap II and Alternate Ammo Type&#39;s being added which made the BO3 Ray Gun useless
