has anyone seen it before? I&#39;ve peeked through all the materials and can&#39;t find anything out of the ordinary. it was originally 
right after &#39;c_zom_dlc4_apothicon_fury_dissolve&#39; in the first error in the linker, but in subsequent links it&#39;s just been under the usual weapon 
camo errors.

So i downloaded and installed them last night. I thought I had them, but I guess I didn&#39;t or I had an older version. But the error persists :( 
Same error as before &#39;fx combo texture&#39; something or other.. i also found this up above the usual weapon camo error. Unsure if it&#39;s related but anything that can help at this point :/

Drag the fx folders back from the other assets

As for your other errors they wonâ€™t stop linker, just a missing image and xcam

You solved this error?

```php
UNRECOVERABLE ERROR:

^1ERROR: Some textures are the wrong type for creating fx combo texture used in the compute sprite and decal rendering
```
I have the same error, how you solved?
