## üíæ Download and version info:

> **IMPORTANT:** By downloading this software you are agreeing to the **EULA** located inside of the archive (EULA.txt).

- Download Link: [Legion (v2.36)](https://mega.nz/file/ZYwXVYyT#wSdVPa1BnRj3eI83D-WxMP-Mu38AvHCmw5YCeyR6Sq0).
- Download Link (TF2 Supported) *NOT FOR APEX*: [Legion Legacy (v2.13)](https://mega.nz/file/4NJSyQyA#4B-XEiAOujpWsECRHsxHwT9PzL_OUY8X9Rf56JA2KYA)
- Requires Visual Studio 2022 x64 Redist: [Redist](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/VC_redist.x64.exe).
- Currently works as of 11/6/2021 updates.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage:
Using Legion is fairly simple as the tool only requires the files located within "Apex\paks\Win64" in order to function.

- The tool features a user interface, just open up an MBnk or RPak to extract assets using `Load File`.

> **IMPORTANT:** Both the tool and the game **require** the entirety of the Win64 folder to be intact and must not be modified in any way.

## Ripping:
- The **.rpak** files contain various encoded assets that Legion can export; and, as of now the currently supported assets are:
  - Textures as [Dds, Png, Tiff]
  - Models as [SEModel, OBJ, XNALara, SMD, CoD XModel, Maya (Legacy), Kaydara FBX, Cast].
  - Animations as [SEAnim, Cast].
- The **.mbnk** file contains all the audio for the game:
  - Sounds as [Wav].
  
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice:
- SE* formats (SEModel, SEAnim are preferred over any other export format and have guaranteed compatibility).
- Legion is considered *feature* complete, and will only receive updates that improve compatibility with new seasons.
