## Usage
Using Wraith Laura is easy, it works by simply using `Load File` to open one of the various `.tangoresrource` files from the game. This will then load and display all models inside. When you export a model, it will export all the required textures for them in the formats you have specified in settings.

> **NOTE:** When looking for assets, a lot of times the asset names aren't exactly what you'd expect. Wraith Laura does however, load all the assets currently available in the respected file you have loaded. If you can't find it, it has a different name.
